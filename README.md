# Storefront E-Commerce API

StoreFront is a sophisticated e-commerce platform designed with a robust technology stack. The backend of the platform is powered by **Django**, leveraging the capabilities of the **_Django Rest Framework_** to create a powerful and flexible API.

**ReactJS** has been used on the frontend to provide a responsive and interactive user experience. The use of  
Vite. js will ensure a **significantly faster development server, better hot-reloading experience, and built-in support for modern JavaScript features like ES modules and TypeScript**, resulting in a more efficient and enjoyable React development process.

StoreFront relies on the **_PostgreSQL_** database engine, known for its reliability and performance. This choice of database ensures that the platform can handle large datasets, transactions, and complex queries, providing a solid foundation for data management.
With this technology stack, StoreFront delivers a seamless and feature-rich e-commerce experience.
